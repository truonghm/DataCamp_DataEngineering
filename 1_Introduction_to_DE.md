## Databases

1. Databases can be relational or non-relational (usually used for caching or distributed configuration). Values in a document database are structured or semi-structured objects, for example, a JSON object.
2. Most popular schema is the star schema: At the center is the **facts** tables, which contain things that happened(eg. Product Orders). Surrounding are **Dimensions** tablesles, which contain information on the word (eg. Customer Information).
